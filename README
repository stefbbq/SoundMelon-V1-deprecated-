Wanted to let you know that I pushed a new commit to git today.
Made a ton of changes to the visuals but overall the most important stuff is some structural changes
I've started to make to better organize things with the views. I'm a bit of a neat freak, so I couldn't help myself :)

We should speak briefly about them in our meeting, but in short, here are a few things:
Started consolidating the terms band, musician, artist, fan and user into the following 3 categories:

* fan user type
* artist user type
* user a universal label for artists/fans for globally reusable elements (such as a user's post) this may evolve
further in the future when we add venues, which will essentially just be another user type

With respect to the above, I've started changing around the folder structure (and their corresponding controllers),
and thus the following folders now exist in place of old ones:

views/fan for all internal, homepage profile stuff
views/fan_public external fan viewing views

views/artist fan all internal, profile stuff when an artist is being managed
views/artist_public currently empty, views/artist/social.haml will have to be moved here eventually as well as corresponding partials

views/bricks instead of shared, all global non-user sensitive elements should go here (logo, footer, etc)

I've started a convention for the major elements on a social page, the partials should be named and be in their
respective folders like so:

header music player/notfications area
live formally the dashboard
social_header menu items above the posts
status_input new post form
left social elements housed on the left side
right sidebar
index fan, fan_public, artist, artist_public should all have their own. They all almost do, except for artist_public still being artist/social.haml
95% of things should work. I broke a lot making these changes, but I think I fixed them all too. We should work to remove any mention of "band" or "musician" from this point out, and make sure that the distinction between "fan" and "user" is maintained. We also need to work towards following the rest of the conventions. There are a few others I'd like to integrate too, but lets discuss. I'd be great if we can do all of our spring cleaning before the beta launch.

Beyond that, I'm almost done with the stylesheets. They're already fairly well organized now, but there's still some
work left.

By the by, I'm fairly certain the registration screens are broken right now because of the changes I've made.
But they'll need to be rebuilt partially anyway because of the new approach discussed before
(where step 1 of fan/artist are both basically on the homepage).

=========================================================================================================================
*******************************************************************************************************************
* Message/follow functionality is now beside their photo (in the live wall, see design for example)

* Add support for artist to specify myspace, facebook and a few other links (will be clickable in live wall area as icons, design for follow)

* Upload jpeg, png, convert to jpeg (decent quality), downsize to a manageable size if needed

* Tour dates : Review tour dates, add/remove, etc. (spec to come)

* Review albums, change titles and names, etc all in a nice and easy to use interface.

*******************************************************************************************************************
Fan/Arist profile improvements
Music Player :
  Working with proper design
  Features album art to the side
  Playlist uses universal popout style (see design. This popout style will also be used for autocomplete with a mention on the status input form among others)
  Logic in place to learn what music the user likes. a "thumbs-up" feature should exist (will be added to design) so the user can specify if they like the current song. Between this and their genre top picks, we should be able to profile them and start to figure out what they like/dislike.
  Logic in place to populate the playlist, ie: radio, based on users likes/dislikes
  In-site advertising
  The marquee, a landing page of blocks that leads a user to things we believe they'll like. using their location, their music profile, age, etc.

  Live wall (a smaller version of the marquee, persistent on all pages at the top beside the users picture. refer to designs)
  Music albums

Upload flac, mp3, aac or wma; convert to mp3 and ogg (probably?) for the music player.
Review albums, change titles and names, queue, download, etc all in a nice and easy to use interface.

Downloadable songs should come with proper meta data and be organized nicely based on how the albums were organized on the site (ie: we should be able to change meta data (say a song name of an mp3) but changing it's visible name in the site album UI.
Photo albums


Proper back button functionality on all elements that change the page (ie:
edit profile, access musicians area,
looking at followers,
the news feed,
hitting latest at the top or mentions, etc)

Revamped registration process
Using the splash screen I had designed as an initial indicator, the 1st step of registering a fan or artist should be right on the first page.
Add terms of service after 1st step.
Custom pages such as the terms of service page, the contact page, the help page, etc will need to be added. It's okay if we bake in these sections in just HAML files for now, but eventually we'll need to have them controllable via. CMS as well (probably right on the page).
